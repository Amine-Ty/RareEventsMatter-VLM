        "The peacock spot or olive leaf spot (Spilocaea oleagina) is the most important olive fungal disease and, together with olive knot, is among the conditions that most affect the well-being of the olive grove. This fungal disease is caused by the fungus Spilocaea oleagina. The symptoms are extremely characteristic and easily recognizable. On olive leaves, the fungus appears as circular grayish spots, darker in the center and surrounded by a yellow halo.",
        "Olive cercospora leaf spot (Mycocentrospora cladosporioides) It is a serious disease caused by the fungus Mycocentrospora cladosporioides, which is widespread in most olive-growing regions of the world. This disease is particularly important because it causes leaf drop and partial defoliation of branches, which weaken the trees and reduce production. The disease may take several years before becoming severe enough in a particular area to cause economic damage. The first signs of cercospora leaf spot appear as gray spots on the underside of the leaves, which seem to be covered with black dust or sooty mold.",
        "Olive anthracnose It is a disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which attacks the fruits causing severe damage under certain climatic conditions and in particular olive varieties. The drupes affected by this fungus show dark, rotting-looking depressions, and the infected fruit, as it evolves, may either fall to the ground or dehydrate and remain attached to the plant, forming the so-called mummies."

These spots are scattered across the entire surface of the leaf, a typical symptom of fungal infection.Around the diseased leaf, the other olive leaves appear healthy, dark green, and intact, which highlights the strong contrast between healthy and infected foliage.
