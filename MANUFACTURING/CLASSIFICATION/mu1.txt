Observation: The metallic specimen is broken in the middle, with relatively smooth fracture surfaces and parallel striations.

Presence of fatigue cracks: âœ… Yes

Where: Cracks start from the lateral edge of the fracture and propagate toward the center. The striation pattern indicates progressive growth under cyclic loads, typical of a fatigue fracture.
