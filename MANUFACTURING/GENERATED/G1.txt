The crack is visible as a thin, dark, irregular line crossing the
metallic surface. Corrosion causes rust formation around the crack,
particularly intense at the edges, indicating prolonged exposure to a
humid or aggressive environment. Cracks are critical stress
concentration points that can propagate over time, weakening the
metallic structure, while the presence of corrosion accelerates
mechanical deterioration.
