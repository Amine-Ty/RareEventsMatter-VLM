The image shows a close-up of an olive tree branch. In the center, there is a yellowing leaf affected by olive peacock spot (Spilocaea oleagina). The leaf displays multiple dark circular lesions, with some spots having darker centers and irregular edges, surrounded by a yellowish halo. These spots are scattered across the entire surface of the leaf, a typical symptom of fungal infection.

Around the diseased leaf, the other olive leaves appear healthy, dark green, and intact, which highlights the strong contrast between healthy and infected foliage. The background is softly blurred, with shades of green from the surrounding vegetation, creating a realistic and natural setting.
