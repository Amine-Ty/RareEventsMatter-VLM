The image shows a close-up of an olive tree branch in a natural setting. Some of the leaves display clear symptoms of peacock spot (olive leaf spot), with dark circular lesions surrounded by yellow halos scattered across their surface. Other leaves on the same branch remain healthy, with a uniform deep-green color. The background is softly blurred, highlighting the contrast between the diseased and healthy foliage while revealing the texture of branches and additional greenery in an orchard-like environment.
